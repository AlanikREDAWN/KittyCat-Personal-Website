# KittyCat's Personal Website

I finally got around to making a personal website!

As of right now, it is super unresponsive, and I don't recommend viewing it on mobile. This is something I plan to fix in a future update somewhere along the line. 

I hope you enjoy my site! All the assets I drew myself, except for the picture of my cat, which is, of course an actual picture.
