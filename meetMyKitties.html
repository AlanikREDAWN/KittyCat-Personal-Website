            <p>This is Alex! He's the older and <br>bigger one of my two kitties! He's <br>the food lover out of both of <br>them and is a bit of an alpha <br>male. He sometimes bullies my <br>smaller cat, Carly, but he's been <br> doing it less, thankfully. He loves <br>people and snuggles!</p>

            <h2>Carly</h2>
            <p>This is Carly! She's the younger <br>of my two kitties, but she's also <br>smaller and smarter! She knows <br>how to outsmart my bigger cat, <br>Alex, when he's bullying her. She <br>is slower to warm up to <br>people, but when she somes <br>around, is the loudest purring <br>machine ever!</p>
